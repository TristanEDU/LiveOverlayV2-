# Phase 13 (Optional) — Advanced Enhancements

Goal
Add power features without hurting simplicity.

Ideas

- Focus-follow: hotkey to focus overlay; quick hide/show.
- Dual-sync (overlay → base) when explicitly enabled.
- Per-site profiles & quick switching.
- Blink-compare mode (rapid visibility toggle).
- Screenshot helpers (external compare).
- Feature Flags
  - Gate advanced features behind settings to keep default simple.
  - Provide safe defaults; clearly label experimental items.

Acceptance

- Enhancements don’t introduce drift or add friction.
